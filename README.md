# PC-Audit-MN: Parenting Consultant Accountability & Reform

## ⚖️ Mission
To provide parents with data-driven tools to audit high-conflict litigation patterns and expose the "conflict-for-profit" loop. This project advocates for a transition from the private, billable-hour Parenting Consultant (PC) model to a state-funded, salaried "Family Court Neutral" system in Minnesota.

## 🛠️ The Toolkit
* **Redundancy Tracker:** Detects when a party re-files issues already settled by court orders.
* **Fee Fairness Calculator:** Audits the proportional financial impact of PC fees on lower-income households.
* **Billing Auditor:** Matches PC invoices against actual case progress to identify "circular conflict" billing.

## 📈 The Problem (The "PC Trap")
In Minnesota, the private PC model incentivizes prolonged conflict. 
* **Economic Disparity:** When one parent earns 3x the other, the 50/50 fee split is used as a tool of financial exhaustion.
* **Lack of Oversight:** Private PCs often operate without the strict transparency required of government employees.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/fayfayMN/PC-Audit-MN.git`
2. Run the fee auditor: `python src/fair_share_calc.py`

* **Labor-to-Fee Auditor:** Quantifies how many hours of manual labor are required to fund one hour of PC services.
