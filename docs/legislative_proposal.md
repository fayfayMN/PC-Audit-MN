# Proposal for Family Court Reform: The Salaried Neutral Model

**Author:** [Your Name / PC-Audit-MN Project]
**Date:** February 2026
**Target:** Minnesota Judicial Branch / State Legislature

### Executive Summary
The current Parenting Consultant (PC) system in Minnesota relies on private practitioners who benefit financially from ongoing parental conflict. This creates a conflict of interest that harms children and bankrupts working-class parents.

### Proposed Changes
1. **Public Funding:** Transition PCs to salaried state employees (similar to Guardians ad Litem).
2. **Fixed Oversight:** Establish a mandatory state audit for any PC who fails to resolve a case within 12 months.
3. **Mandatory Fee-Shifting:** Automatically shift 100% of costs to the party found to be filing "Redundant" or "Vexatious" motions.

### Data Evidence
Using the `PC-Audit-MN` toolset, we can demonstrate that private PCs often allow "re-litigation" of settled issues, leading to thousands of dollars in wasted parental resources.
